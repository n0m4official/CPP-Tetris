## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting a Vulnerability
This project is educational and does **not** handle sensitive data, but we still care about code quality and safety.  
If you discover a vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, unsafe input handling, undefined behavior), please:

1. **Do not open a public issue** immediately.  
2. Instead, contact the maintainer directly on Discord:  
   **[@tacticalkig_](https://discord.com/)**  
3. Provide:
   - A description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Potential impact (e.g., crash, memory corruption)  

We will:
- Review the report within **7 days**  
- Aim to release a patch or mitigation within **14 days**  
- Acknowledge your contribution in the changelog if desired
